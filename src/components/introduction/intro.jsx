    <p className='quest'>1. What is Figure ?</p>
    <p className='text-desc'>Is it a model, a statue, or any other name for 3D artifacts held in one's hand that simulate characters in drawings, movies, stories, or games...
    Figures are usually people, but they can also be animals, plants, monsters, elves, gods, or even aliens...</p>

<p className='quest'>2. What is Japan Figure ?</p>
    <p className='text-desc'>* These are the first prototypes created, illustrated, 
    sculpted, and perfected by Japanese artists.</p>
    <p className='text-desc'>*  The majority of the design was then sent to China for mass production. 
     As a result, the finished product you hold in your hand with the words "Made in China"
     is quite normal.</p>
    <p className='text-desc'>*  Because it is from Japan, it is obvious that it has a strong Japanese 
    culture, ranging from Anime, Manga, Game, Light novel, J-pop to virtual singer, 
    virtual streamer, and so on.</p>
    
    {
    Introimg2.map(img => (<img className='part2-pic' src={img} alt=''></img>))
  }

<p className='pic-desc'>Picture 2: Both pictures above here are Japan Figure Anime</p>
<p className='text-desc'> The finished figure products are very soulful of the original 
characters, with sharp details, vivid colors, and well packaged, thanks to Japanese 
technology and a strictly supervised production process.</p>
<p className='text-desc'>Thanks to that, the Japanese figure has satisfied fans all over the world.</p>
